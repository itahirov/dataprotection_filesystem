# dataprotection_filesystem

Project does not contains all the files necessarry to run it. 

But the files can be generated by **dotnet new mvc** command

DataProtection keys saving to custom local file system example.

csproj file contains necessary libraries to connect to blob storage.
They might need to be installed by running **dotnet restore** 

So after running this project by **dotnet run**, you will see new xml file inside the keys directory of your project 

You can also apply keys protection with certificate or with dpapi

 services.AddDataProtection()
 .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo("keys"))
 .ProtectKeysWithDpapi();
 
 I just didn't test keys protection but persisting works fine (tested both on local and on azure app service)
